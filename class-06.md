# Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming

- **idea behind the Protein Tracker application is that it allows a user to set a goal for the amount of protein to consume in a day.**

- Normally when you put together a jigsaw puzzle you follow steps that might look something like this:
  - 1. Figure out what the major components of the picture are
  - 2. Sort the pieces by color or component
  - 3. Put together all the border pieces
  - 4. Put together each component of the picture from the piles you created

- If understanding the problem domain is the hardest part of programming and you want to make programming easier, you can do one of two things:

  - 1. Make the problem domain easier
  - 2. Get better at understanding the problem domain

**You can often make the problem domain easier by cutting out cases and narrowing your focus to a particular part of the problem.**


# Object Literals

**WHAT IS AN OBJECT?**
  - group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world.

- If a *variable* is part of an object, it is called a **property**.
- If a *function* is part of an object, it is called a **method**.
- In an *object*, that name is called a **key**.
- you access the properties or method of an object using *dot notation*. 
- you can also access properties using *square brackets*. 

  
# Document Object Model
 
- **The Document Object Model (DOM):** specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

- **Application Programming Interface (API):** User interfaces let humans interact with programs.
- **The dom tree:** is a model of a web page.

##  Each node is an object with methods and properties.

**DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.**

- Method that find elements in the DOM tree are called *DOM queries*.
- **When you need to work with an element more than once, you should use a variable to store the result of this query.**
- DOM queries may return one element, or they may return a Nodelist, which is a collection of nodes.
 ### METHODS THAT RETURN A SINGLE ELEMENT NODE:
    - getElementByld('id')
    - querySelector('css selector')

### METHODS THAT RETURN ONE OR MORE ELEMENTS (AS A NODELIST):
    - getElementsByClassName('class')
    - getElementsByTagName('tagName')
    - querySelectorAll ('css selector')

**NODELISTS:** DOM QUERIES THAT RETURN MORE THAN ONE ELEMENT
  - **live Nodelist:** when your script updates the page, the Nodelist is updated at the same time.
  - **static Nodelist:** when your script updates the page, the NodeList is not updated to reflect the changes made by the script.

**There are two ways to select an element from a Nodelist:**
  - The item() method and array syntax.
  - Both require the index number of the element you want.
**You can select element nodes by their id or class attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.**

- **TRAVERSING THE DOM:** When you have an element node, you can select another element in relation to it using these five properties.

- Traversing the DOM can be difficult because some browsers add a text node whenever they come across whitespace between elements.
  
### ADDING ELEMENTS:
  - Using the **innerHTML property**, you can access and amend the contents of an element, including any child elements.
  - **DOM manipulation** offers another technique to add new content to a page (rather than innerHTML).
     - involves three steps:
      - 1. CREATE THE ELEMENT
      - 2. GIVE IT CONTENT
      - 3. ADD IT TO THE DOM

 - If you add HTML to a page using i nnerHTML (or several jQuery methods), you need to be aware of Cross-Site Scripting Attacks or XSS; otherwise, an attacker could gain access to your users' accounts.

**Whenever a DOM query can return more than one node, it will always return a NadeList.**
    - Any content generated by users that contain characters that are used in code should be escaped on the server. You must control any markup added to the page.

### Attribute Nodes:
   - Once you have an element node, you can use other properties and methods on that element node to access and change its attributes. 

  
**From an element node, you can access and update its content using properties such as textContent and innerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.**
