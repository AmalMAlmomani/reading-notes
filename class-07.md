# Domain Modeling

- **Domain modeling:** is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem.
- **A model:** describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain.
- **An entity** that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an *object-oriented* model.


# Tables 
- **table:** represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
- Basic Table Structure:
  - `<table>`
    - `<tr> table row </tr>`
      - `<th> table heading</th>`
      - `<td> table data </td> `
 - **Spanning Columns:** Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column.
 - **Spanning Rows:** You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row.
 - **For long tables you can split the table into a `<thead>, <tbody>, and <tfoot>`.**



# Functions, Methods, and Objects 

**CREATING MANY OBJECTS:**
  - CONSTRUCTOR NOTATION
- The keyword *this* is commonly used inside functions and objects.
- To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values.
-  In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
- A **variable** has just one key (the variable name) and one value.
- **Arrays** can store multiple pieces of information.
- The **window object** represents the current browser window or tab. It is the topmost object in the Browser Object Model, and it contains other objects that tell you about the browser.
- Each character in a string is automatically given a number, called an *index number*.

### DATA TYPES REVISITED:
  - 1. String
  - 2. Number
  - 3. Boolean
  - 4. Undefined (a variable that has been declared, but no value has been assigned to it yet)
  - 5. Null (a variable with no value - it may have had one at some point, but no longer has a value)
  - 6. 0bject Under the hood, arrays and functions are considered types of objects.

## GLOBAL OBJECTS:
  - DATE OBJECT (AND TIME)
    - JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
