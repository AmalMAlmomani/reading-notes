#  CSS Transforms
  - Now general layout techniques can be revisited with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements.
    -  two different settings
      - two-dimensional
      - and three-dimensional
    - 2D Transforms
      - Two-dimensional transforms work on the x and y axes, known as horizontal and vertical axes. 
      - Three-dimensional transforms work on both the x and y axes, as well as the z axis.
     - 2D Rotate
       - provides the ability to rotate an element from 0 to 360 degrees.
     - 2D Scale
       - scale value within the transform property allows you to change the appeared size of an element. 
     - 2D Translate
       - works a bit like that of relative positioning, pushing and pulling an element in different directions without interrupting the normal flow of the document.
     - 2D Skew
       -  is used to distort elements on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, or both. 
- **Combining Transforms**
  - multiple transforms can be combined together.

- **Transform Origin**
  - property can accept one or two values. When only one value is specified, that value is used for both the horizontal and vertical axes. If two values are specified, the first is used for the horizontal axis and the second is used for the vertical axis.

- **Perspective**
  - works great for transforming one element from a single, unique perspective.
